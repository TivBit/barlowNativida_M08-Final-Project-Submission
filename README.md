M08: Final Project Submission

This is the program files for the SDEV 220 final project.  The Django Web App consisted of a blog and an attempt at an ATM application.  

Bug Report:
Where do I start?  The web app ran fine when it was just the blog.  I was able to post, edit, and approve/decline comments.  When I tried to built the ATM application, I was able to get the app to run independently with when all of the Python code was in one file and it ran in the console, but there was an issue with the views.py file and somewhere in the routes and storage.  Ultimately, the webpage would not populate at all.  I added the atm.py file, which has the ATM program in it, to this repository, but all in all, the project fell flat.  I will definitely have to revisit this project in the future.  I would love to see it go live.  Until then, although it was a challenge to learn, I still love Python and Django. ~T.Barlow, SDEV 220 Student | C.Francis, Instructor.
